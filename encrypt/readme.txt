---------------------------------------------

	tEncoder is an encryption software designed to encrypt PHP files for use as software. tEncoder uses a complex encryption system to encode PHP scripts into standalone encrypted scripts. SCRIPTS RUN THROUGH tEncoder DO NOT REQUIRE ANY SOFTWARE TO RUN. They are standalone meaning they run by themselves. All you need to do is upload your script, encode it, and download it. It's as simple as that.
	To install tEncoder, upload all files to a directory on your web space and change attributes for all files and directories to 0777 which is ["Read", "Write", "Execute"] permissions for ["Public", "Owner", "Other"] groups. And that's it.

*** FAQ ***

Q: What requirements are needed to run tEncoder?
A: All that is needed are a PHP-enabled web server (preferably Apache) and some free web space.

Q: Are there any limitations with my encoded scripts?
A: No. All scripts encoded come out functioning fully as they would before. No back-end coding is added to your scripts.

Q: Why should I use tEncoder or any encryption for my software?
A: tEncoder ensures that software cannot be modified by other users. If you want your software to be protected from modification, you should encode your software.

Q: What scripts will tEncoder encrypt?
A: tEncoder will only encrypt PHP scripts. Any other scripts will not work.
